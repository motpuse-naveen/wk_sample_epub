<p class="nonindent">Blood component therapy is the mainstay of treatment for hemorrhagic shock, acute or chronic anemia, and acquired or congenital disorders in hemostasis. Anesthesiologists serve a unique role as perioperative physicians frequently charged with the management of patients suffering acute blood loss or coagulopathy. Therefore, it is important to understand the physiologic principles of oxygen delivery and hemostasis, the risks and safety precautions associated with blood-product transfusion, and the pharmacology of anticoagulants, antithrombotics, and procoagulant medications.</p>

<p class="dify">Transfusion of separated blood components, such as RBCs, plasma, or platelets, allows for targeted treatment and saves a precious resource.</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">Blood-product transfusion is conventionally performed with individual component therapy targeted to replace the specific deficiencies at hand. Most patients require only a single blood component or a combination of selected components. For example, red blood cells (RBCs) are needed to treat anemia with evidence of tissue hypoxia, whereas plasma is used to treat coagulopathy and factor deficiencies. Separating blood transfusion into component therapies allows for targeted efficient treatment while also minimizing the risks of transfusion reactions and transfusion-transmitted infection. Whole blood transfusion is reserved for initial emergent treatment of trauma or active bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Packed red blood cells (PRBCs)</i></b> are the most common blood product transfused worldwide, with over 10.5 million units administered annually in the United States.<sup><a href="#bib1">1</a></sup> A unit of PRBCs is obtained from a single donor and consists of about 300&#160;mL, with a hematocrit of approximately 60% to 70% and only about 20 to 30&#160;mL of plasma. One unit of PRBCs generally increases the patient&#8217;s hemoglobin concentration by 1&#160;g/dL. <b><a href="#tt24-1">Table 24.1</a></b> describes blood component storage and preparation.</p>
<p class="headd"><i><b>Did You Know?</b></i></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">There is no general rule regarding the minimum hemoglobin at which patients should be transfused. The trigger for transfusion should be individualized for each specific patient.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The clearest indication for PRBC transfusion is acute blood loss or anemia with evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. Patients suffering hypovolemic shock secondary to critical bleeding require resuscitation with PRBCs, but they may also require treatment of dilutional coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. The recommended transfusion threshold during acute hemorrhage in hemodynamically unstable patients is higher to provide oxygen carrying capacity during active bleeding, but still restrictive (hemoglobin goals of &#62;7.0-9.0&#160;g/dL) given the risks associated with allogenic blood-product transfusion.<sup><a href="#bib2">2</a></sup> Transfusion for major bleeding should also include replacement of coagulation factors and platelets with consideration given to administration of medications and strategies for blood conservation.</p>

<p class="indent">The transfusion threshold for hemodynamically stable patients with anemia has been the topic of many review articles and original studies for over 2&#160;decades. The controversy stems around the balance of the benefits of RBC treatment for anemia and the risks of transfusion. Most international guidelines, including the AABB, formerly the American Association of Blood Banks, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the British Society for Haematology (BSH), and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, agree that restrictive transfusion practices are indicated for most hemodynamically stable trauma, perioperative, and critically ill patients.<sup><a href="#bib2">2</a>-<a href="#bib6">6</a></sup> There are a few circumstances, such as hemorrhagic shock, major orthopedic surgery with a history of cardiovascular disease, and cardiac surgery, where higher transfusion triggers are indicated to maximize oxygen delivery to end organs under stress. Otherwise, hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of tissue hypoxia (elevated lactate levels, low central venous oxygen saturation) generally tolerate hemoglobin levels as low as 7.0&#160;g/dL with compensatory mechanisms to increase cardiac output and oxygen extraction at the tissue level. <b><a href="#ff24-1">Figure 24.1</a></b> describes a suggested clinical algorithm based on international guidelines for patient blood managment.<sup><a href="#bib2">2</a>,<a href="#bib5">5</a>,<a href="#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Plasma</i></b> contains all the clotting factors, fibrinogen, and plasma proteins from whole blood donation or apheresis. Each unit is collected from a single donor and must be frozen within 6 to 8 hours to be designated fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Most of the plasma currently collected in the United States is frozen within 24 hours (PF24) with minimal detrimental effects on its efficacy. However, it is most appropriate to use the term &#8220;plasma&#8221; moving forward as opposed to FFP to account for all types of plasma products.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup> The volume of 1 unit of plasma is approximately 250&#160;mL, with physiologic levels of stable clotting factors and approximately 50% to 60% of labile factors VIII and V after 5&#160;days of thawed storage. The most recent report from the National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) documents significant declines in the transfusion rates of plasma products; however, there are still over 3.2 million plasma units administered annually in the United States.<sup><a href="#bib1">1</a></sup> The most common indications for plasma transfusion are treatment of dilutional coagulopathy and factor deficiency. The current guidelines recommend basing the dose of plasma transfusion therapy on coagulation assay results. However, when testing is not available, the initial recommended dose for factor repletion in a bleeding patient is 10 to 20&#160;mL/kg. Other indications for plasma transfusion include replacement of antithrombin in cases of long-term heparin use or as a second-line agent for warfarin or direct acting oral anticoagulant reversal. There is no indication for the use of plasma as prophylaxis in a patient with abnormal coagulation studies but no bleeding or pending invasive procedure.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a>,<a href="#bib9">9</a></sup></p>

<p class="video2"><b>Blood Transfusion Compatibility</b></p>
<p class="indent">Plasma contains the antibodies to blood type antigens and should therefore be compatible when transfused. <b><a href="#tt24-2">Table 24.2</a></b> presents the plasma compatibility profiles as they compare with RBC component compatibility. The ABO blood system is the major carbohydrate-based blood-borne antigen system that induces naturally occurring immunoglobulin-M (IgM) antibodies without the need for RBC exposure. Thus, ABO incompatibility for PRBCs or plasma-containing components carries significant risk of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (discussed in depth below). Type AB plasma is the universal plasma donor as it does not contain any ABO blood cell antibodies, but limited amounts of group A plasma may be given in emergencies before ABO typing is available. Type O patients are the universal recipient for plasma because there are no A or B antigens in type O blood. The RhD blood group compatibility is of significant concern in women before and throughout their reproductive age as alloimmunization may result in complications during pregnancy. Alloimmunization is of highest risk in RhD negative patients who receive RhD positive RBCs. Plasma products do not typically contain enough RBCs to cause alloimmunization and may be transfused without concern for RhD compatibility.<sup><a href="#bib9">9</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent"><b><i>Cryoprecipitate</i></b> (sometimes simply called &#8220;cryo&#8221;) is produced after a controlled thaw and centrifuge of FFP. The yield of cryoproteins that precipitates from 1 unit of FFP is reconstituted in 15 to 20&#160;mL of plasma. It must contain at least 150&#160;mg of fibrinogen and at least 80&#160;international units (IU) of factor VIII. Therefore, a dose of cryoprecipitate is usually pooled from four to six separate donors in approximately 60 to 120&#160;mL and contains a high concentration of fibrinogen relative to plasma, as well as clinically significant amounts of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, factor XIII, and fibronectin.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a>,<a href="#bib9">9</a></sup> Hypofibrinogenemia and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) are the most common indications for cryoprecipitate transfusion. Given the low volume of plasma from each donor in a pooled dose of cryoprecipitate, the overall immune-mediated risks are relatively small.</p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Platelet</i></b> transfusions have increased approximately 5% over recent years despite an overall reduction in blood-product administration.<sup><a href="#bib1">1</a></sup> This is presumed to be secondary to the aging population and increased incidence of hematopoietic malignancies. Platelets are produced either as a pooled unit from four to six whole blood donors or from a single or double apheresis donation. Unlike other blood components, they have a short shelf life of only 5 to 7&#160;days, and they are stored at room temperature and therefore have carried a higher risk of bacterial contamination. Because of this, pathogen-reduction treatment of platelets, which inactivates bacteria and other pathogens, is being introduced more widely.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup> Typically a single dose of platelets (pool or apheresis) is expected to increase the platelet count initially by 25,000 to 30,000 per microliter. However, the response to platelet transfusion varies greatly depending on the indication, acuity, and systemic syndrome of the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Platelet transfusion may be indicated when platelets are decreased as a result of dilution, bleeding, destruction, or sequestration. Transfusion thresholds for thrombocytopenia depend on whether the patient has clinical signs of bleeding or whether bleeding or the risk of bleeding involves the closed intraorbital, intracranial, or neuraxial spaces. In these high-risk instances, the transfusion threshold is &#60;100,000 per microliter. Otherwise, for surgical patients where bleeding is anticipated and prophylaxis is desired, the threshold is generally &#60;50,000 per microliter. Guideline recommendations for lumbar puncture suggest a threshold of at least 40,000 per microliter prior to performing a lumbar puncture and 80,000 for insertion or removal of an epidural catheter. Patients without clinical signs of bleeding are not at risk of spontaneous hemorrhage until the platelet count drops to &#60;10,000 per microliter.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a>,<a href="#bib10">10</a></sup> Platelet transfusion may also be necessary for patients with qualitative deficiencies that are acquired or congenital. Commonly acquired platelet dysfunction occurs with extracorporeal circulation, such as cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or with medications or systemic illnesses, such as liver disease and uremia. Concerns for platelet dysfunction in a patient with signs of bleeding should prompt a platelet function test or viscoelastography.<sup><a href="#bib5">5</a></sup> Cold-stored platelets have very short circulation times but are hemostatically more activated and have been reintroduced by the military because they can be refrigerated for &#60;14&#160;days for remote or prehospital use.<sup><a href="#bib11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Whole blood</i></b>, usually given as low-titer group O whole blood (LTOWB), can be used for initial emergency transfusions to rapidly provide RBCs, plasma, and platelets simultaneously.<sup><a href="#bib12">12</a></sup> When donors with high anti-A and anti-B ABO antibody titers are avoided, LTOWB can be safely given to non-O patients. Whole blood can be administered as fresh warm units from prescreened walking donors in austere environments or it can be refrigerated for &#60;14&#160;days. Practices vary as to antibody titer cutoffs or limits on numbers of units given.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="sec2"><span class="cr">II.</span> Blood Compatibility</h2>
<p class="headd"><i><b>Did You Know?</b></i></p>
<p class="nonindent">RBC compatibility testing consists of typing for ABO and Rh(D), screening the plasma for non-ABO antibodies, and crossmatching prospective RBC units. Group O, A, and B persons have naturally occurring strong plasma anti-A and/or anti-B to the antigen(s) they lack, and RBC units must be ABO compatible to avoid hemolytic transfusion reactions. D-negative persons can easily make anti-D when exposed to D-positive RBCs and should normally receive D-negative RBCs. This is especially important for girls and women of reproductive age to avoid risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn in future D-positive fetuses. One to 2% of all patients and 5% to 20% of multitransfused patients have non-ABO hemolytic alloantibodies to Rh and other blood group antigens. These antibodies must be identified so that RBC units negative for the target antigens can be given to avoid hemolysis. After these &#8220;type and screen&#8221; tests, donor RBC units are crossmatched to the patient, either by computer confirmation (electronic crossmatch) or, if significant antibodies are present, by serological crossmatching of plasma versus donor RBCs. Compatibility testing routinely takes 45 to 60 minutes or longer if RBC alloantibodies, warm (IgG), or cold (IgM) autoantibodies are present. If RBCs must be given emergently before testing is completed, uncrossmatched group O RBCs (D-negative for girls and women of reproductive age) are the best choice, after weighing the risk of non-ABO hemolytic RBC antibodies. In an emergency, as a guide to help remember that group O is a &#8220;universal donor,&#8221; think of the &#8220;O&#8221; in donor.</p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In an emergency, when a bleeding patient&#8217;s blood type is not known and there is no time to perform a crossmatch, it is best to transfuse RBCs which are type O, and in females &#60;50&#160;years old, RhD-negative.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="section" id="sec3"><span class="cr">III.</span> Blood Administration</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Before transfusion, it is mandatory that the blood bank&#8217;s transfusion <b><i>tag</i></b> on the blood unit be carefully checked against the blood <b><i>bag</i></b> and the patient&#8217;s <b><i>wristband</i></b> identification to avoid a hemolytic reaction from administering the wrong blood or component. All blood components must be administered through a 150- to 260-&#956;m blood filter to prevent clots from entering the patient&#8217;s bloodstream. Products should be infused within 4 hours of issuance from the blood bank. A blood warmer should be used in rapid large-volume transfusions to avoid hypothermia and may be recommended for transfusing RBCs to patients with cold autoantibodies.<sup><a href="#bib6">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="section" id="sec4"><span class="cr">IV.</span> Transfusion Reactions</h2>
<p class="nonindent">With over 16 million blood components transfused annually, the risks of transfusion are relatively rare, with an overall incidence of 282 reactions reported per 100,000 units transfused.<sup><a href="#bib1">1</a></sup> More than half of these reactions are mild, febrile nonhemolytic reactions or mild to moderate allergic reactions, and the incidence of life-threatening transfusion reactions declined significantly over the past few years from 9.4 per 100,000 units transfused in 2015 to 4.7 severe transfusion reactions per 100,000 units transfused throughout the United States in 2017.<sup><a href="#bib13">13</a></sup> Transfusion reactions are often organized by pathophysiology into immune-mediated or nonimmune-mediated reactions. The latter include transmission of infection (eg, hepatitis C) or metabolic derangements associated with massive transfusion (eg, hypocalcemia). <b><a href="#tt24-3">Table 24.3</a></b> summarizes many of the reported noninfectious adverse effects of transfusion, and the following sections will focus on some of the most clinically significant reactions.</p>
<p class="headd"><i><b>Did You Know?</b></i></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions most often result from errors made by medical personnel. It is critical that blood donors and recipients be properly identified and all labels on blood products be properly matched to those individuals.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Hemolytic transfusion reactions</i></b> result from intravascular or extravascular hemolysis of endogenous and transfused RBCs, typically when the recipient expresses antibodies to blood-borne antigens within the donor product. This reaction is acute and severe when transfusion involves the naturally occurring IgM anti-A and anti-B antibodies to the ABO blood cell antigens. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTRs) are rare (1:40,000) and almost always result from clerical errors with blood sampling, typing, crossmatch, or erroneous administration of an inappropriate blood product to the wrong patient. Rarely, transfusion of incompatible plasma can also result in acute hemolysis reported less than once every 50,000 transfusions (<b><a href="#tt24-2">Table 24.2</a></b>).<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Vigilance for the diagnosis of AHTR must remain high because many of the signs and symptoms can be masked during general anesthesia. Responsive patients may complain of chest pain, or abdominal discomfort. Vital signs become unstable, with hemolysis and diffuse bradykinin and histamine release leading to hemoglobinuria, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and bronchospasm. AHTRs are best treated with supportive care after discontinuing all blood-product transfusions and initiating investigation into the etiology of the incompatibility. The mortality from AHTR remains high with approximately 2% to 7% of mistransfusions being fatal as patients may progress to multiorgan system failure from systemic shock, DIC, acute renal failure, and obstructive hepatic dysfunction.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR)</i></b> often occur days after blood-product administration and are typically less severe, presenting with progressive anemia, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria in the absence of hemodynamic instability. DHTR results from a humoral reaction to antigens in transfused blood products in recipients with a history of alloimmunization to antigens such as Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, among others. <b><i>Alloimmunization</i></b> occurs with pregnancy or exposure to blood-product transfusion as the recipient develops antibodies to blood-borne antigens at a rate of about 1 per 1500 to 3000 RBC transfused. This puts these patients at risk for future hemolytic transfusion reactions and emphasizes the importance of antibody screening and complete crossmatch prior to nonemergency transfusion.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent"><b><i>Posttransfusion purpura (PTP)</i></b> is a rare complication; but PTP carries high risk and mortality as it results in significant thrombocytopenia 7 to 10&#160;days post transfusion. Patients with a history of alloimmunization secondary to pregnancy or previous transfusions are at highest risk of PTP. Treatment includes high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and supportive care.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)</i></b> remains one of the leading causes of transfusion-associated morbidity and mortality. Consensus diagnostic criteria require acute (within 6 hours of transfusion), noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with bilateral infiltrates and a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the inspired concentration of oxygen of &#60;300 (eg, 200/0.75). Blood products with high plasma content are generally implicated in the majority of the cases of TRALI, which can be explained by two suggested pathophysiologic mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent">The most likely cause involves antineutrophil (anti-HNA) or anti-HLA antibodies formulated in multiparous female donors during a past pregnancy or as a result of sensitization from previous transfusions or transplantation. In fact, the practice of using male-predominant plasma donors significantly decreases the incidence of TRALI. The second commonly discussed &#8220;two hit hypothesis&#8221; for TRALI implicates the role of pro-inflammatory biologic response modifiers released in stored blood products that activate primed neutrophils in the recipient. Both pathophysiologic mechanisms result in breakdown of the capillary alveolar membrane, interstitial pulmonary edema, and microscopic alveolar hemorrhage, all of which lead to acute lung injury. The treatment for TRALI focuses on supportive care and lung protective low tidal volume mechanical ventilation as the low-pressure pulmonary edema does not generally respond to diuretic therapy.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)</i></b> is one of the most frequent serious complications of blood therapy with an incidence of about 1:50 component transfusions. It results from high-pressure cardiogenic pulmonary edema frequently associated with large volume or rapid transfusion. It is not an immune-mediated response and occurs more frequently in critically ill patients or those with a history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease. These patients develop hypoxemia secondary to ventilation perfusion mismatch and intrapulmonary shunt. Furthermore, patients express an elevated level of brain natriuretic peptide in response to ventricular distension. Typically, TACO responds to diuretic treatment and pulmonary alveolar recruitment.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Transfusion-transmitted infections</i></b> have been a focus of transfusion medicine research for several decades, which has resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of infection for recipients of allogeneic transfusion. The overall rate of transfusion-transmitted infections was significantly lower in the 2017 NBCUS than the number reported in 2015.<sup><a href="#bib13">13</a></sup> The greatest fear among blood transfusion recipients usually concerns viral infections such as hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, these are actually a rare result of blood-product transfusion because of the increased sensitivity of donor screening tests now available and a short window of time between donor infection and seroconversion. Transfusion transmission of hepatitis B has also declined because of widespread vaccination. Over the past few years, many blood centers have introduced pathogen-reduction technology to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination especially with apheresis platelet components. Accordingly, the incidence of posttransfusion sepsis, or transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections, is quite rare. <b><a href="#tt24-3">Table 24.3</a></b> summarizes the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infections.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="sec5"><span class="cr">V.</span> Perioperative Alternatives to Transfusion</h2>
<p class="nonindent">The risks of transfusion are indisputable. Even 1 unit of PRBCs can significantly increase perioperative morbidity. Fortunately, there are some blood conservation strategies to minimize allogenic RBC transfusion. Experts in transfusion medicine advocate for Patient Blood Management (PBM) programs defined by the AABB as &#8220;an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to optimizing the care of patients who might need transfusion.&#8221; PBM uses preventive strategies and active management protocols to optimize patients prior to surgery and mitigate the risks of acute anemia and transfusion during active hemorrhage, while minimizing the incidence of adverse reactions to blood component therapy.<sup><a href="#bib7">7</a>,<a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><i><b>Did You Know?</b></i></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Only in unusual circumstances is it appropriate to transfuse an anemic patient prior to elective surgery. The cause for anemia should be found and the patient treated. Alternatives to transfusion, such as perioperative cell salvage, should be considered.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for perioperative blood transfusion, morbidity, and mortality. Thus, strategies to conserve and even increase the patient&#8217;s hemoglobin concentration prior to surgery should be considered for all elective cases. There should be a thorough preoperative diagnostic workup for the cause of the anemia and, if indicated, aggressive treatment of an iron deficiency or replacement of vitamin deficiencies (eg, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> or folic acid). With a longer lead time before surgery for diagnosis and treatment of anemia, fewer patients require perioperative transfusion.<sup><a href="#bib7">7</a>,<a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Iron therapy</i></b> is an important consideration for patients with preoperative anemia secondary to iron deficiency. Oral formulations for iron replacement are often associated with gastrointestinal upset and therefore poorly tolerated by patients long enough for them to be effective. However, intravenous iron therapy is more readily available as iron sucrose and iron gluconate, which carry far less risk of anaphylaxis than previous formulations.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Erythropoietin</i></b> is the most common erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) approved for use in patients with end-stage renal disease, presurgical anemia, and chemotherapy or malignancy-associated anemia. Erythropoietin increases RBC production in the bone marrow and has been shown to reduce allogenic transfusion requirements when used prior to orthopedic and cardiac surgery, especially if administered with iron repletion.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup> However, it carries a significant risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism and therefore should be used conservatively and with close patient monitoring.<sup><a href="#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Autologous blood donation</i></b> (collection and saving of the patient&#8217;s own blood for later use) reduces several of the risks associated with allogenic blood transfusion, including viral infection and immune reactions such as TRALI and alloimmunization. However, preoperative autologous donation has not been shown to reduce perioperative allogenic transfusion due to the resultant lower preoperative hemoglobin concentration. Autologous blood donation still carries the risks associated with clerical error, bacterial contamination, TACO, and storage lesions. Furthermore, there is significant risk of donated blood expiring prior to surgery date if surgery is postponed or delayed for any cause. Certain patients may be candidates for autologous transfusion if they have antibodies to high-prevalence blood antigens, multiple alloantibodies, or they refuse allogenic transfusion and are at risk for significant surgical blood loss; in those cases, ESAs should be used in conjunction with preoperative donation.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Acute normovolemic hemodilution</i></b> involves the removal of 2 or 3 units of whole blood with volume replacement with intravenous fluids immediately preincision. The blood is typically stored in the operating room but may be preserved for 8 hours prior to reinfusion. This results in the patient losing blood at a lower hematocrit during surgery and for the patient to be resuscitated with autologous whole fresh blood after most of the surgical blood loss has resolved. This method is very efficacious in young healthy patients who can tolerate intraoperative anemia without risk of end-organ hypoxia or for patients who have a higher risk of transfusion reactions from allogenic blood products. It can also be considered for patients who refuse allogenic transfusions including those of the Jehovah&#8217;s Witness faith as the blood removed can be kept in continuity with the patient at their request.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Perioperative blood salvage</i></b> with intraoperative &#8220;cell saver&#8221; technology or postoperative intracompartment cell salvage is the most used and efficacious method for perioperative blood conservation. Especially in orthopedic surgery for total knee arthroplasty and hip replacement, perioperative cell salvage has significantly decreased patient risk for blood transfusion. Postoperative cell salvage is generally limited to orthopedic surgery as mediastinal cell salvage after cardiac and thoracic surgery has been associated with worse postoperative bleeding and morbidity.</p>

<p class="video1"><b>VIDEO 24-2</b></p>
<p class="video2"><b>Intraoperative Blood Salvage</b></p>
<p class="indent">Intraoperative RBC salvage systems typically involve three phases, all of which must be run by trained operators to optimize RBC return and minimize risks. Shed blood is first anticoagulated and collected with limited variable suctioning to minimize the detrimental effects of sheer forces. Inefficient collection may increase the risk of hemolysis. Suction of wounds contaminated with frank infection, ruptured tumor sections, amniotic fluid, metal, or pharmaceutical compounds may increase the risks associated with cell salvage. Generally, leucodepletion filters limit the white blood cells and contaminants, including tumor cells and amniotic fluid contents, from entering the collection chamber. Thus, intraoperative cell salvage systems remain acceptable in obstetrics, as well as any procedures with anticipated blood loss &#62;1000&#160;mL. Collected blood is centrifuged, washed, filtered, and reconstituted to a resultant hematocrit of 45% to 55%.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup> Meta-analysis of studies using cell salvage in urologic and gynecologic cancer surgery demonstrates that it is safe and is not associated with additional risk of tumor recurrence or metastasis. Risks associated with reinfusion of salvaged RBCs include air embolism and hemolysis. But these risks are minimal when the system is used properly and still negligible when compared with the risk of allogeneic blood transfusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, perioperative blood salvage is cost-efficient, low risk, and clinically effective at reducing the need for RBC transfusion. It is particularly important when considering use of perioperative blood conservation strategies for patients requiring rare blood types and those who are Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, who generally refuse any transfusion when RBCs have been removed from the body. Often Jehovah&#8217;s Witness patients will accept RBC salvage if the salvaged blood remains in continuity with the patient. This is easily established with a primed venous line attached to the reinfusion bag of the cell savage system.</p>
<p class="indent"><b><i>Oxygen carriers</i></b> as blood substitutes are an attractive alternative to transfusion, eliminating many of the risks associated with RBC administration. There are no compounds currently approved for human use, although this is an active field of research. Unfortunately, blood substitutes containing recombinant hemoglobin molecules have been associated with hypertension and renal and liver dysfunction, while substitutes containing perfluorocarbon compounds, which increase the fraction of dissolved oxygen, commonly cause thrombocytopenia. Hopefully, further studies will provide an efficient low-risk alternative blood substitute.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="section" id="sec6"><span class="cr">VI.</span> Primary Hemostasis</h2>
<p class="nonindent"><b><a href="#ff24-2">Figure 24.2</a></b> shows the three general phases of platelet function: adherence, activation, and stabilization. When the blood vessel is injured, platelets adhere via surface receptors to underlying collagen and to von Willebrand factor (vWF) on endothelium or in a blood clot. These engaged receptors set off signaling pathways mediated via phospholipase C (PLC) to cause platelet activation. In the activation phase, platelets secrete numerous agents to stimulate other platelets, including calcium (Ca<sup>++</sup>), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and serotonin released from dense granules, and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> produced from arachidonic acid via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway. The outer platelet membrane has receptors for these agonists, including the P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor for ADP and for thrombin, setting off further internal signaling via PLC. Activated platelets also release &#945;-granules containing activated factor V for the coagulation cascade, and they change shape from round to flat and spiky. Finally, in stabilization, PLC mediates &#8220;inside-out&#8221; signaling to activate the surface receptor for fibrin and vWF binding. Other activated platelets crosslink to fibrin and vWF at these sites, creating the platelet-fibrin plug.</p>
<p class="headd"><i><b>Did You Know?</b></i></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The process of coagulation is complex, involving numerous components and interactive processes. If time permits, the cause for unusual bleeding should be carefully elucidated and therapy precisely targeted. In an emergency, &#8220;shotgun&#8221; therapy with fresh frozen plasma or platelets may be necessary.</p>

<p class="nonindent0"><b><span class="col1">A.</span> Secondary Hemostasis</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Classically, the coagulation cascade is subcategorized into (1) the <b><i>extrinsic pathway,</i></b> activated by tissue factor (TF) from cells outside a disrupted blood vessel; (2) the <b><i>intrinsic pathway,</i></b> involving only plasma factors; and (3) the <b><i>common pathway,</i></b> fed by both the intrinsic and extrinsic to form thrombin, then fibrin (<b><a href="#ff24-3">Figure 24.3</a></b>). However, the extrinsic and common pathways also amplify the intrinsic pathway. Each of these three pathways has a central enzyme complex with four parallel elements: a plasma enzyme, a cofactor (mostly cell or platelet derived), the Ca<sup>++</sup> ion, and a phospholipid (PL) platform provided in vivo by the platelet <br/>membrane.</p>
<p class="indent">The extrinsic pathway activates factor X to Xa via the extrinsic &#8220;ten-ase,&#8221; comprising enzyme factor VIIa (activated by TF), its cofactor TF, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and PL. The intrinsic pathway activates Xa with the intrinsic ten-ase, containing enzyme IXa, cofactor VIIIa, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and PL. In the common pathway, the Xa enzyme formed by these processes combines with cofactor Va, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and PL to form prothrombinase. Prothrombin is then converted to thrombin, which in turn converts fibrinogen to the end product fibrin.</p>
<p class="indent">When thrombin is formed, it also amplifies the intrinsic VIIIa to IXa ten-ase: thrombin activates VIIIa and XIa, which produces IXa. The extrinsic ten-ase also makes some IXa for the intrinsic ten-ase. Thrombin amplifies its own prothrombinase by activating some plasma Va. However, platelets provide most of the Va by taking up plasma factor V, converting it to Va, and then secreting Va during platelet activation. Finally, thrombin also activates factor XIII, which crosslinks and stabilizes the fibrin clot.</p>
<p class="nonindent0"><b><span class="col1">B.</span> Fibrinolysis</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Fibrin is broken down by plasmin after the need for hemostasis has resolved. Plasmin is activated from plasminogen in several ways: (1) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) from endothelial cells cleaves plasminogen and is itself activated by plasmin; (2) urokinase from the endothelium and kidney activates plasminogen; (3) factor IXa and the contact factors XIIa and kallikrein, associated with the intrinsic pathway, activate a minor fraction of plasminogen. Contact factors can activate XIa during in vitro testing (partial thromboplastin time) but not in vivo. Fibrinolysis is also regulated. The &#945;<sub>1</sub>-antiplasmin and thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) inhibit plasmin. TAFI and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) interfere with tPA function, and PAI-1 promotes clearance of tPA and urokinase.</p>
<p class="nonindent0"><b><span class="col1">C.</span> Regulation of Hemostasis</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Platelet activation is physiologically inhibited by nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>) secreted by endothelial cells. NO stimulates a pathway leading to inhibition of the thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> receptor. PGI<sub>2</sub> binds to a platelet receptor, which signals for suppression of vWF adherence, PLC function, and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> activation.</p>
<p class="indent">Secondary hemostasis is also regulated at several junctures (<b><a href="#ff24-3">Figure 24.3</a></b>). Tissue factor pathway inhibitor, secreted by endothelial cells and facilitated by its cofactor protein S, dampens functions of extrinsic TF-VIIa ten-ase and the common pathway Xa. Antithrombin, particularly when bound to heparin, inhibits thrombin and all the other enzyme factors.</p>
<p class="indent">Activated protein C cleaves extrinsic VIIIa and common-pathway Va. Protein C is activated by protein C-ase, comprising the enzyme thrombin, a cofactor thrombomodulin secreted by endothelial cells, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and PL.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="sec7"><span class="cr">VII.</span> Pharmacology</h2>
<p class="nonindent"><b><i>Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications</i></b> target various points within the hemostatic pathways. Antiplatelet medications prevent platelet activation and aggregation, while anticoagulant medications inhibit coagulation factor activation at various points within secondary hemostasis. <b><a href="#tt24-4">Table 24.4</a></b> outlines the specific targets inhibited by each drug along with some details about monitoring their effect and drugs that can be used in the event of bleeding emergencies.</p>
<p class="headd"><i><b>Did You Know?</b></i></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Use of low-dose aspirin is ubiquitous among patients because it is an effective prophylaxis against myocardial infarction. It acts by irreversibly inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase and impairing platelet aggregation. It should be discontinued more than a week before intraocular or intracranial surgery to reduce the risk of devastating hemorrhage.</p>
</div>
<div class="table">
<p class="TABLEpNUM" id="tt24-4"><span class="tab">Table 24-4</span> Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Medications</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="images/tt24-4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of treatment for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, thereby preventing the synthesis of thromboxane, a major stimulant for platelet activation. The second most used class of antiplatelet medications includes clopidogrel and ticlopidine, P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonists, which result in a decreased expression of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of activated platelets, thereby inhibiting platelet adhesion and aggregation. Finally, the direct glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists&#8212;abciximab and eptifibatide&#8212;prevent platelet aggregation by inhibiting the crosslink of fibrinogen. These agents are only available for intravenous administration and are primarily used in treatment of acute coronary syndrome.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfractionated heparin is one of the oldest and most used medications for anticoagulation, especially for emergency treatment of pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, vascular thrombosis, or cardiopulmonary bypass. It acts by improving the affinity of antithrombin for thrombin, thereby inhibiting the final step of secondary hemostasis. The therapeutic effects of heparin primarily inhibit the intrinsic and common coagulation pathway and can be monitored with the activated partial thromboplastin time or the activated clotting time. However, it is a large molecule with significant risks of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a disorder characterized by microvascular thrombosis secondary to platelet-activating IgG antibodies to the heparin and platelet factor 4 complexes. Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin, fondaparinox, and dalteparin inhibit the activation of factor X as a means of preventing thrombin formation and hemostasis. They are smaller molecules with longer half-lives making them less likely to cause HIT and suitable for intermittent therapeutic dosing that does not require an infusion. Enoxaparin should be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction and creatinine clearance &#60;30&#160;mL/min. Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors such as argatroban and bivalirudin bind to free thrombin preventing ongoing hemostatic activity. They are primarily indicated for patients with HIT or those with a heparin allergy and can be monitored with activated clotting times.<sup><a href="#bib14">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Warfarin is a classic oral anticoagulant medication clinically used for treatment and prophylaxis in patients at high risk for stroke or venous thromboembolism such as those with a hypercoagulable disorder (ie, lupus anticoagulant, factor V Leiden, antithrombin deficiency) or a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, heart valve replacement, or atrial fibrillation. Mechanistically, it is a vitamin K antagonist that prevents the hepatic synthesis of vitamin K&#8211;dependent coagulation factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X. Incidentally, it also prevents the synthesis of protein C, a natural anticoagulant with a short half-life. Therefore, patients initiated on warfarin treatment will be hypercoagulable for the first 1 to 2&#160;days until the available supply of factors is depleted. The effective concentration of warfarin is highly variable between patients and commonly affected by food and drug interactions. Regular monitoring is necessary and facilitated by the international normalized ratio (INR), a hemostatic assay designed to normalize the prothrombin time across different laboratories for patients with a combined deficiency of factors II, VII, IX, and X. For patients on warfarin therapy who experience a bleeding emergency, the warfarin should be reversed with vitamin K supplementation or 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). Plasma is the second-line therapy indicated for urgent warfarin reversal only if PCCs are not available.<sup><a href="#bib14">14</a></sup> The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) include dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban, direct factor Xa antagonists. This class of anticoagulants is very popular for patients at risk of venous thromboembolism or stroke related to atrial fibrillation because of their rapid onset, simple dosing, and lack of need for regular laboratory monitoring secondary to a high degree of bioavailability and few significant drug or food interactions.<sup><a href="#bib15">15</a></sup></p>
<div class="table">
<p class="TABLEpNUM" id="tt24-5"><span class="tab">Table 24-5</span> Oral Anticoagulant Medications</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="images/tt24-5.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">There is active research around specific antidotes for treatment of critical hemorrhage or bleeding emergencies in patients on DOACs. Dabigatran can be fully reversed with the administration of the monoclonal antibody, idarucizumab.<sup><a href="#bib16">16</a></sup> Furthermore, there is widely accepted evidence and FDA approval for the use of andexanet alfa, an inactive recombinant form of coagulation factor Xa, for the blockade of direct acting factor Xa inhibitors including rivaroxaban and apixaban.<sup><a href="#bib17">17</a></sup> Andexanet alfa has not been studied for edoxaban, although the mechanism of effect is directed at all factor Xa inhibitors. In the absence of andexanet alfa, current recommendations dictate the use of 4-factor PCCs for treatment of critical bleeding in patients on DOAC therapy.<sup><a href="#bib15">15</a></sup> In the stable patient scheduled for surgery, the most recent guidelines suggest waiting four to five half-lives of a DOAC prior to elective procedures, including neuraxial anesthesia, and longer for patients with renal insufficiency. <b><a href="#tt24-5">Table 24.5</a></b> outlines the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin versus the DOACs.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a>,<a href="#bib18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hemostatic medications serve an integral role in patient blood management and the control of hemorrhage by promoting the formation and stabilization of blood clots. There are several mechanistic targets for procoagulant agents from the initiation of primary hemostasis to the activation of clotting factors. However, it is imperative that these agents target only the site of vascular injury as systemic activation of hemostatic pathways can lead to catastrophic arterial and venous thromboembolism.</p>
<p class="indent">Desmopressin (1-deamino-8-<small>D</small>-arginine vasopressin [DDAVP]) is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin with a wide range of hemostatic effects, some of which are still poorly understood. DDAVP is clinically indicated for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with platelet dysfunction, often related to uremia, hemophilia, and von Willebrand disease, as it facilitates the cleavage of factor VIII and vWF to increase the activity of both factors, thereby improving platelet function. Additionally, DDAVP provides a modest decrease in bleeding associated with major surgery such as spinal fusion, revision orthopedic procedures, and high-risk cardiac surgery, without a significant increased risk of thromboembolism. Other adverse effects of DDAVP include hyponatremia and resultant cerebral edema, but this is clinically rare in the adult population.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Antifibrinolytics prevent the dissolution of established blood clots, thereby improving vascular integrity at the site of injury and decreasing bleeding. There are two types of antifibrinolytics. Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor that directly inhibits plasmin. It is not available in the United States because a large randomized trial demonstrated an association between use of aprotinin and increased morbidity and mortality. However, it has been proven to be effective at decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements for patients undergoing high-risk surgery and is currently approved for use in Canada and Europe.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The lysine analogue antifibrinolytics, including epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (TXA), inhibit the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin. They are less potent than aprotinin and in comparative trials less effective, but the incidence of thromboembolism and adverse effects from TXA and EACA are minimal, making them an attractive option for prophylaxis in patients at risk for major bleeding. Large clinical trials in trauma patients, as well as many studies in cardiac and orthopedic surgical patients, have documented the clinical efficacy of these medications especially when used prophylactically.<sup><a href="#bib3">3</a>,<a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Factor concentrates provide the substrates for the secondary hemostasis phase of the clotting cascade without the transfusion risks associated with plasma administration. Concentrates can be delivered individually when indicated, for example, factor VIII concentrates in classic hemophilia. Recombinant activated factor VII is currently approved for treatment of hemophilia in patients with inhibitors to factors VIII or IX.</p>
<p class="indent">PCCs have different compositions, but generally include varied amounts of three to four factor concentrates, including factors II, IX, X, and sometimes VII. For most of the PCCs, these factors are administered inactive and complexed with an anticoagulant such as antithrombin, protein C, or heparin, making the overall therapy less likely to cause unwanted thromboembolism. PCCs are currently indicated for treatment of hemophilia patients with inhibitors to specific factor concentrates. However, they are more frequently used as the first-line reversal agents for warfarin and the DOACs in cases of critical bleeding. It is important to recognize that these medications carry a risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism and should be redosed with extreme caution. They are contraindicated in patients with suspicion of having DIC, a systemic disorder of uncontrolled hemostasis with microvascular clotting, coagulation factor, and platelet consumption that may progress to multiorgan system failure and massive hemorrhage.</p>
